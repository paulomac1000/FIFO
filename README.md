# Memory module simulation - FIFO algorithm
Memory module based on FIFO alghoritm. Created as a part of simulation of operation system. 
One of my first c# application so it is very amateur, but everyone has to start somewhere. Implemented for classes "Systemy Operacyjne 1" (Operation Systems 1) and assessed at the maximum score.
